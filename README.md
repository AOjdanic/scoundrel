This is a rust implementation of a game known as scoundrel, which is a dungeon crawler card game.

It is currently playable only in a terminal, but i have plans to create a GUI game as well.

if you want to play this game:

- make sure you have rust/cargo installed
- clone this repository locally
- cd into it
- execute command "cargo run"
- enjoy!
